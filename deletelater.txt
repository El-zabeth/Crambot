explanation:

Yes, based on your code, you should first upload the PDF document(s) and click the "Submit & Process" button before asking your question. Here’s how it works step-by-step:

1. **Upload PDF Files**: In the Streamlit app, use the file uploader in the sidebar to upload your PDF files.

2. **Submit & Process**: After uploading the files, click the "Submit & Process" button. This triggers the following actions in your code:
   - The `pdf_read` function reads the text from the uploaded PDF files.
   - The `get_chunks` function splits the extracted text into manageable chunks.
   - The `vector_store` function creates a FAISS index from these text chunks and saves it to the `faiss_db` directory.

3. **Ask Your Question**: After processing the PDF files, you can then use the text input field to ask your question. The app will attempt to load the FAISS index and use it to retrieve relevant information based on your question.

### Key Points
- If you attempt to ask a question before clicking "Submit & Process," the application will try to load the FAISS index, which may not exist yet, resulting in the error you encountered.
- Ensure that the FAISS index is created successfully during the processing step before attempting to use it for answering questions.

### Code Logic
Here's a simplified flow of your code:

- **File Upload** → **Submit & Process Button** → (Read PDFs → Split Text → Create & Save FAISS Index) → **Ask Question** → (Load FAISS Index → Retrieve Answers)

So make sure to follow this order for the app to work correctly!
